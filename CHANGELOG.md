# Changelog

All notable changes. Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org); every release is a git
tag and a GitHub release. The full design history is in [docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md).

## Unreleased

## v0.9.1 - 2026-10-02
- Scaling phase 1 (docs/SCALING.md): output that is the same for everyone (node state,
  the whole queue, partitions, the site catalog) is cached once on the hosted server
  for all people instead of once per person, and identical commands in flight run once.
  Per-person output and writes are never shared. 5 new mutation guards.

## v0.9.0 - 2026-10-02
- Program clients: pre-registered OAuth clients in `users.yaml` (`clients:`) for programs
  such as Ultra. A program acts as the person who signed it in, with the person's tiers
  capped by the program's `tiers` ceiling (never a grant) and its own `calls_per_min`
  budget, separate from the person's chat clients. Program ids can't be registered or
  claimed; a disabled program is refused at sign-in, code exchange, refresh and on every
  request. Audit records read `program:<id>/<mcp client>`; `/whoami` shows the program,
  capped tiers and budget. One SSH connection per person, shared by their own clients
  and their programs. Files without `clients:` behave exactly as before.
- MIT License.

## v0.8.2 - 2026-10-02
- Docs and packaging only, no code change: README rewrite, `docs/CLIENTS.md` (Hermes,
  Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, claude.ai, OpenAI API, scripts),
  `examples/mcp_client.py`, community files.
- Release binaries for Linux and macOS (amd64, arm64) with SHA256SUMS, and a one-line
  installer `scripts/get.sh`.

## v0.8.1 - 2026-10-02
- First day on shared nodes: the no-cores error reads as a sentence; `script_check`
  ignores module loads and run-time patterns inside comments. 116 mutation guards.

## agent-v0.3.0 - 2026-10-02
- ursa-agent 0.3.0: read-only cluster dashboard (pulse, jobs, usage, waste, storage,
  partitions, software, staged files; staff views).

## v0.8.0 - 2026-10-02
- Shared partitions: sharing read live from Slurm; on a shared partition a script must
  ask for its cores or `script_check` / `job_submit` refuse it; costs are the share of the
  node the job holds.

## v0.7.2 - 2026-10-02
- `module_show` loads the package's MPI first (hierarchical Lmod), new `mpi` argument;
  `ticket_draft` calls a completed job a success; `jobs_list` default page 50.

## v0.7.1 - 2026-10-02
- At most 8 concurrent SSH sessions per connection (login node MaxSessions is 10);
  refused channels retried on the same connection; transport errors reported as such.

## v0.7.0 - 2026-10-01
- Files in and out: staged uploads via signed links pulled by the job, `results_link`
  download links, paging for results, reads and logs with grep; helper tools
  `storage_usage`, `files_list`, `files_read`, `env_check`, `interactive_help`. No shell tool.

## v0.6.0 - 2026-10-01
- ursa-agent (ADK Gemini agent: chat page + A2A, approvals in code); `/whoami`.

## v0.5.0 - v0.5.4 - 2026-10-01
- Hosted server `bifrost serve`: MCP over HTTP, OAuth via Google sign-in, per-user
  identity, tiers and caps (v0.5.0); deployed on Cloud Run with `/health` (v0.5.1);
  access tokens survive restarts in a sealed store (v0.5.2); one-click repeat sign-in
  (v0.5.3); command-not-found diagnosis (v0.5.4).

## v0.4.0 - 2026-10-01
- Per-user IAP + OS Login backend (`backend: iap`).

## v0.3.0 - v0.3.3 - 2026-10-01
- Act tier A1: submit, cancel, hold, release with confirm tokens and caps; `job_results`
  (v0.3.0); fixes from the live test campaign, NO_VAL timestamps, MPI-aware
  `script_check` (v0.3.1-v0.3.3).

## v0.2.0 - v0.2.2 - 2026-10-01
- Staff tier R2: `waste_report`, `health`, `ticket_draft`; python-error diagnosis rule;
  `modules_search` returns containers and recipes.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-10-01
- First release: read-only MCP server and CLI for Ursa Major (phase P1).
